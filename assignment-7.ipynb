    "\n",
    "1. Lack of Planning \n",
    "\n",
    "befor integrating data from multiple sources we can make sure below questions\n",
    "\n",
    "-What am I integrating?\n",
    "\n",
    "-What formats do I have to join together?\n",
    "\n",
    "-How can this data be useful to our company?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using Manual Data Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The best option, instead of using manual data integration methods, is to use an automated data integration tool that collects data in real-time, processes it so you have it ready when you need it, and will be able to process data without lost man-hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lack of Scalability ability\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the best-automated data integration tools won’t be able to help a business that continues to grow…if it is not designed for scalability.Taking the time to understand how data from your acquisitions will fit into your own, or data from new customers, helps prevent lag time and poor buyer experience\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Low-Quality Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is erroneous or of poor quality, automated data integration tools will not be able to successfully analyze it and integrate it for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s best to begin looking at useful data integration tools and data quality management tools as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Duplicated Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicated data is a common error that around 94% of businesses suspect they might be suffering from. These businesses believe that their customer information is erroneous, including being duplicated across multiple platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "To help address these issues, make data de-duplication a priority. On platforms such as Hubshout, for instance, there are lots of de-duplication features such as the ability to merge data, quality checks, and recognizing missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data in the Wrong Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to data duplication, data stored in different formats can be challenging to integrate into your ETL process. for instance, your human resources department might save phone numbers in the format (000) 000-0000, while your sales department might save it under 000-000-0000.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, make sure to stress to your different departments the importance of data formatting across multiple platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use data wrangling tools that are designed to format data across different platforms into a single, usable base language. Data wrangling tools such as Talend are invaluable in their ability to transform raw data into valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Data Not Available When Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of data integration processing methods, known as batch processing and real-time processing. Batch processing is designed to take large amounts of data and process them during a single session, producing information for a later stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although batch processing can be a good tool to use for larger sets of data, they have many downfalls, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Must be used during downtime\n",
    "You won’t have access to the data until after the downtime\n",
    "Can be prone to error, which will lead to errors in the entire data batch\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, real-time processing takes smaller amounts of data, processes it quickly, and allows you to have access to this information when you need it in “real-time.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Although real-time processing can be difficult to design, it is well worth the investment in real-time processing tools so you can get the data as soon as it is available.\n"
